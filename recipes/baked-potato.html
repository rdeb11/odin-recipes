    <h2>Baked Potato, perfect winter food!</h2>
    <p>If you've been searching for the perfect baked potato that everyone will love, your search ends here! This baked
        potato recipe yields a baked potato that's crispy on the outside, but fluffy on the inside â€” just like the
        perfect baked potato should be.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 medium baking potato</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon olive oil</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons butter</li>
        <li>1 pinch freshly ground black pepper</li>

    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C). Scrub the potato, and pierce the skin several times with
            a knife or fork. Rub the skin with olive oil, then with salt.</li>
        <li>Place the potato in the preheated oven, and bake until slightly soft and golden brown, about 90 minutes.
            Slice the potato down the center, and serve with butter and black pepper. Sprinkle shredded Cheddar cheese
            over the top, if desired.</li>
    </ol>
